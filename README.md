## Features

* See a Signup Form for an imaginary form.
* The sign up form has a basic password validation.
* The form uses alot of different CSS values of REM, VH, VW values which I previously did not know about. 
* It also uses the complex HTML structure with CSS Flexbox to build the layout with.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### UI / UX
* It only involves basic password validation. 
* The form uses Flexbox for the layout.
* The main practice for this project was being comfortable with CSS Relative values like rem, em, vh, vw etc. 

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
The Sign Up Form was the perfect project to practice relative CSS values like rem, em, vh etc. In the previous projects, I was used to
only doing them in the pixel values (px). But, after doing this project, I was comfortable in using the CSS values and using different
CSS advance functions.
